                  <h2>Goal</h2>
                  <p class="section-summary">ClickMechanic offers their customers price quotes for car repair jobs taking into account the customer's current car, repair parts' prices, mechanic labour time, oil refill, and many other details.</p>
                  <p class="section-summary">Because of the arised complexity from the variability of the jobs, a considerable amount of price quotes could not be fulfilled due to the impossibility of having each possible repair part in the inventory database or the need for computing labour times for many possible combinations of job parameters. This represents a very real problem since the platform is not of much of a use for the user if it cannot determine the price quote after the customer inputs quite some specific data in some cases. Providing customers with better service through more adequate estimates is a must in this situation.</p>
                  <p class="section-summary">Machine Learning is a good fit for this type of problem, since there was a considerable amount of data coming from the jobs already delivered by the platform so far, as well as having the necessity of estimating quotes on those same jobs.</p>
                  <p class="section-summary">It was also important to provide useful feedback to the user in the event that the price quotation could not be computed with enough confidence by the system .</p>

                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>We initially received a preliminary dataset consisting of several months of historical requests from the site, this dataset already contained some few hundred thousand records. Afterwards, we started the exploratory data analysis to decide what was the best approach to the problem. From this analysis we decided that a machine learning model was indeed an appropriate and feasible solution, so we implemented a preliminary baseline model with the available data and the results were promising since it was possible to predict with some reasonable accuracy the part’s prices. We agreed on trying to estimate the parts prices so that they could be fed back on the existing system in an easier manner.</p>
                    <p>After the preliminary analysis promised results, we then received a more complete dataset of about a year of historical requests data (now going into millions of requests) which allowed us to train more precise models using different algorithms to find the one that generated the more accurate model.</p>
                    <p>After many model training/testing iterations we trained a model with enough accuracy for testing it against a real world scenario to validate its generalization power. With this model we generated the predictions for all the combinations of input parameters (mainly information about the customer's car parameters) and sent it to the client for testing.</p>
                    <p>Once this was done, the next challenge was to deal with the labour time computation for the jobs. For this, we followed the same approach as to the previous problem since the historical data was similar.</p>
                    <p>The very first results were already quite promising and we finally could tune a model for predicting the labour times quite accurately, with a mean error of just mere minutes from its actual value.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we discussed possible integration points to use the machine learning model within the existing application.</p>

                      <p>This model has allowed ClickMechanic the expand the number of quotes that are presented to the clients and that are including pricing and development times. These values have been predicted with very good results and the business has benefited from higher closing rates on their service.</p>
