                <p>If Codescrum decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is Codescrum's practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.</p>
                <p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your personal information to protect the rights or property of Codescrum, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>
